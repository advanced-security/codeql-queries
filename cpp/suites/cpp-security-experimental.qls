# Use with caution ⚠️ experimental queries are not assured for performance or false positives

# Use in a CodeQL workflow
# e.g. use from where it is or copy to `./.github/codeql/java-experimental-security.qls`
# then alter the workflow to look like:
#
#    # Initializes the CodeQL tools for scanning.
#    - name: Initialize CodeQL
#      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
#      with:
#        languages: [cpp]
#        queries: security-extended,advanced-security/codeql-queries/cpp/suites/cpp-security-experimental.qls
#        # or
#        queries: security-extended,./.github/codeql/cpp-experimental-security.qls
